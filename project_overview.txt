Project Overview

This document serves as a placeholder for the screenshot submission in the application process.

Project Description:
The project demonstrates a basic vulnerability scanning and attack simulation tool built in Python. The scripts are designed to identify SQL Injection vulnerabilities and simulate a basic SQL Injection attack. The project aims to showcase cybersecurity concepts and provide a starting point for web application security testing.

Files Included:
1. **vulnerability_scan.py**: A script to scan for potential SQL Injection vulnerabilities in web applications.
2. **attack_simulation.py**: A simulation of a SQL Injection attack.
3. **scan_results.txt**: A sample output file showing the results of the vulnerability scan.
4. **security_best_practices.md**: A documentation file outlining best practices for securing web applications.
5. **requirements.txt**: A file listing the dependencies required for running the Python scripts.

Instructions:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the vulnerability scan with `python vulnerability_scan.py`.
4. Simulate the SQL Injection attack using `python attack_simulation.py`.

This document is submitted as part of the application to demonstrate the work and provide a description of the project setup.
